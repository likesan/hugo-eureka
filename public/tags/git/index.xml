      <description>Struggled with pushing Vim-fugitive. The main issue was happening whenever I tried to push on Vim-fugitive.
Problem  load Username failed  fatal: could not read Username for &#39;https://github.com&#39;: No such device or address  ssh-askpass error  ssh_askpass: exec(/usr/bin/ssh-askpass): No such file or directory debian  Cause The message meant that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t verified with my own SSH.
Solution  had to install ssh-add, through sudo apt-get install ssh-add. firstly made sure whether do I have the keygen existed by ls -al ~/.</description>

      <description>The problem So, the problem was that I had to keep writing down my credential info for pushing onto git repo.
Solution   git config credential.helper store
  git push &amp;lt;repo&amp;gt;
  git config --global credential.helper &amp;quot;cache --timeout 7200&amp;quot; This setting will expire your cached credential info for 2 hours later.
  Conclusion  git config credential.helper store commands order to store the git user info (pw, id) in local env - It can raise security issue.</description>

When I just able to upload the publicfolder to the gh-pages only, during wrapping up all git changes, I was the only way to seperately manage the hugo blog well. the right way was subtree. The git&amp;rsquo;s subtree function</description>
