      <description>wanted to know what can I learn if attend the school.
Even though I&amp;rsquo;m not that much prepared with French.
They mainly focus on teaching code with C. C is the mostly interesting language for me, by its usage in various machine.

  There is an argument which is 42ecole system doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any valide result, on LinkedIn</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ll get start to learn C language. Even I didn&amp;rsquo;t start or make any installation with that in this Linux laptop, but I believe there would be many profit for myself.

As I&amp;rsquo;m into permaculture, one day I&amp;rsquo;ll try to make the better enviroment construct by the installation of sensors in a place to optimize the growth of crops.</description>
